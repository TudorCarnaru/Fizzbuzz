# Task5: WIP - Created container, it's running the application but can't find localhost for VM (running windows8.1) - possibly a config/port problem
# Task6: Finished


# Starting up the application 
  - Import the project via pom.xml (this should create a spring boot run configuration) and start up the java application

  - For running the tests, please adjust the variable localhost to point to the port of the local running machine(for me it was 8181)
  
  - -Starting the angular application is done by navigating into the filepath of ~/angularclient/src in a terminal, and running the npm -install command first in order to get all of the dependencies installed, then running the npm start command, which will make the -angular application available on localhost:4200
